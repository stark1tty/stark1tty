# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Schedule to run the workflow every day at a specific time (UTC)
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Additional step for generating contribution graph
      - uses: Platane/snk@v3
